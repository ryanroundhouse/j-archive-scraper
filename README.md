- Files organized by year/month (e.g., `output/2025/10/`)
- Error detection for missing/invalid game IDs
- Batch scraping with success/failure tracking
- Season scraping - scrape all games from a season page
- Support for special tournaments (Celebrity Jeopardy, Masters, ToC, etc.)
- Utility script to reorganize existing files

## Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. When you're done, deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Usage

### Single Game Scraping

Basic usage with a game ID:
```bash
python scraper.py 9293
```

Specify a custom output filename:
```bash
python scraper.py 9293 my_output.json
```

The game ID can be found in the URL. For example:
- URL: `https://j-archive.com/showgame.php?game_id=9293`
- Game ID: `9293`

### Batch Scraping

Scrape a range of games:
```bash
python batch_scraper.py 9290 9295
```

Scrape specific games:
```bash
python batch_scraper.py --list 9293 9294 9295
```

Add a delay between requests (recommended):
```bash
# Range mode - positional or --delay flag
python batch_scraper.py 9290 9295 2.0
python batch_scraper.py 9290 9295 --delay 2.0

# List mode - --delay flag
python batch_scraper.py --list 9293 9294 --delay 2.0
```

### Season Scraping

Scrape all games from a season page:
```bash
# Using full URL
python season_scraper.py https://j-archive.com/showseason.php?season=pcj

# Using season code
python season_scraper.py pcj

# With custom delay
python season_scraper.py pcj 2.0

# With custom output directory (keeps seasons separate)
python season_scraper.py pcj 2.0 output_celebrity
python season_scraper.py toc 2.0 output_toc
python season_scraper.py masters 2.0 output_masters
```

**Common season codes:**
- `42` - Current season
- `41` - Last season
- `pcj` - Primetime Celebrity Jeopardy!
- `toc` - Tournament of Champions
- `masters` - Jeopardy! Masters

**Custom output directories:** By default, all games are saved to `output/`. Use the third parameter to specify a different directory for organizing different tournaments or seasons separately.

## Output Format

The script generates a JSON file with the following structure:

â””â”€â”€ 2025/
    â””â”€â”€ 10/
        â”œâ”€â”€ jeopardy_game_9289.json
        â”œâ”€â”€ jeopardy_game_9290.json

```

This script automatically activates the virtual environment and runs the email sender.

**Set up a daily cron job (runs at 9 AM every day):**

```bash
# Edit your crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (adjust path to your installation):
0 9 * * * /Users/rg/git/jeopardy-scrape/send_daily_jeopardy.sh

0 9 * * * /Users/rg/git/jeopardy-scrape/send_daily_jeopardy.sh >> /Users/rg/git/jeopardy-scrape/daily_email.log 2>&1
```

**Manual run:**
```bash
# Using the shell script (recommended)
./send_daily_jeopardy.sh

# Or directly with Python
