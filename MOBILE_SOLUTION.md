# Mobile-Friendly Solution for Daily Jeopardy Email

## The Challenge

Interactive "click-to-reveal" or "hover-to-reveal" features don't work reliably in HTML emails, especially on mobile devices, because:
- Email clients have very limited CSS support
- JavaScript is completely blocked for security reasons
- Mobile devices don't support hover states
- Different email clients (Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, etc.) render HTML differently

## The Solution: Scroll-Based Reveal

After researching mobile-friendly email techniques, we implemented a **scroll-based reveal** approach that works universally across all devices and email clients.

### How It Works

1. **Questions Section** (Top)
   - All 3 Jeopardy questions are displayed first
   - Each question card shows:
     - Category and dollar value
     - The clue
     - Game metadata
     - "Think you know it?" prompt

2. **Visual Separator**
   - Clear divider with "⬇️ SCROLL FOR ANSWERS ⬇️" text
   - 300px transparent spacer creates physical separation
   - Prevents accidental spoilers when viewing questions

3. **Answers Section** (Bottom)
   - All answers displayed in separate cards
   - Each answer clearly labeled with question number
   - Shows category for easy reference
   - Professional "WHAT IS / WHO IS / WHERE IS..." Jeopardy format

### Why This Works

✅ **Universal Compatibility**: Works on all devices and email clients
✅ **Mobile-First**: Perfect for mobile screens - natural scrolling behavior  
✅ **No Special CSS**: Uses only basic, well-supported CSS
✅ **Intuitive UX**: Users naturally understand "scroll down for answers"
✅ **No Accidental Spoilers**: Spacer prevents seeing answers while reading questions
✅ **Professional Look**: Maintains beautiful Jeopardy styling throughout

### User Experience

**On Desktop:**
- User scrolls through 3 questions
- Scrolls down to see answers
- Can easily scroll back up to re-read questions

**On Mobile:**
- Natural thumb-scrolling through questions
- Clear visual cue to keep scrolling
- Answers appear after purposeful scroll
- Easy to reference back to questions

### Technical Details

**No Interactive Elements Required:**
- No hover states
- No click handlers
- No checkbox hacks
- No JavaScript
- No advanced CSS selectors

**Just Simple, Reliable HTML/CSS:**
- Standard divs and spans
- Basic background colors and borders
- Simple layout with flexbox for headers
- Media query-friendly responsive design

## Comparison to Other Approaches Tried

### ❌ Hover to Reveal
- **Problem**: Doesn't work on mobile (no hover state)
- **Result**: Answers visible on mobile devices

### ❌ Select/Highlight to Reveal
- **Problem**: Black text on black background unreliable in email clients
- **Result**: Some clients strip the styling, others don't allow text selection

### ✅ Scroll to Reveal
- **Advantages**: Works everywhere, intuitive, reliable
- **Result**: Perfect experience on all devices!
